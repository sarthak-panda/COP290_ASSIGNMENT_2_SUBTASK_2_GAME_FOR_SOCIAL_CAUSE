                <b>Social Importance</b>

                <p>The game carries significant social importance. It promotes <b>empathy</b>, <b>responsibility</b>,
                    and <b>care for the
                        elderly</b>, as seen in the boy's actions towards the old man. It emphasizes the importance of
                    timely
                    medical care and the role each one of us can play in ensuring the well-being of those around us.</p>

                <p>The game also highlights the importance of <b>education</b> and <b>discipline</b>, as the boy
                    balances his social
                    service with his schoolwork. The visit to the temple introduces a spiritual element, encouraging
                    players
                    to consider their spiritual health alongside their physical and mental health.</p>

                <p>However, the game concludes with a reminder that while exercise is important, it's equally crucial to
                    listen to one's body and understand its limits. This could be interpreted as a message to balance
                    physical activity with adequate rest, promoting a holistic approach to health and well-being. This
                    change further enhances the game's social relevance by promoting a balanced lifestyle.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, this game serves as a powerful tool for promoting social values and responsibilities
                    among its players, making it not just a source of entertainment but also a medium for social change.
